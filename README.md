# Misc. Userstyles

When I'm browsing the web I often find myself tweaking a site's CSS to suit my tastes (usually hiding annoying elements). It's not super helpful to keep these to myself, so I'm uploading them here.

## Install
- Grab a userstyle browser extension like [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
- Click on one of the `*.user.css` files in this repo
- Click the `Raw` button to be taken to the installation page
